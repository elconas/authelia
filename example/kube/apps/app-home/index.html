    <h1>Authelia on Kube</h1>

    In this example, two applications have been deployed along with Authelia and a fake mailbox in order to confirm your secret registration to Authelia:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://app1.kube.example.com">https://app1.kube.example.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://app2.kube.example.com">https://app2.kube.example.com</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://mail.kube.example.com">http://mail.kube.example.com</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please note that <b>app1</b> is publicly available and <b>app2</b> is protected by Authelia.<br/>
      <br/>
      You can start by visiting <b>app1</b> and then try to access <b>app2</b>. Since <b>app2</b> is protected by Authelia, you will be redirected to Authelia's portal.<br/>
      <br/>
      If it's the first time you login in this cluster, you'll need to choose your authentication method and follow Authelia's instructions.<br/>
      <br/>
      Once done, you'll be able to authenticate with your selected second factor method.
